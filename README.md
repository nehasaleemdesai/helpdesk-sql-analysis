# Helpdesk SQL Project  
_SQL project analyzing customer support data with PostgreSQL_

A structured SQL project using a fictitious Helpdesk dataset (customers, agents, and tickets). The objective is to design relational tables, write queries, and validate outputs to simulate real-world support analytics.  

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses  
- Ticket resolution times (overall and by team)  
- Customers with the highest ticket volumes  
- Average resolution times across teams  
- % of tickets resolved within 48 hours  
- Most common issue categories by region  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **PostgreSQL** (database + queries)  
- CSV datasets (`customers`, `agents`, `tickets`)  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents  
- `queries.sql` â†’ all SQL practice queries  
- `datasets/` â†’ sample CSVs for customers, agents, and tickets  

## ðŸŽ¯ Skills Demonstrated  
- SQL joins, aggregations, subqueries 
- PostgreSQL features: `DISTINCT ON`, `FILTER`, and date arithmetic  
- Translating business questions into SQL-based insights  
- Validating query logic with real datasets
